## Introduction

In this post, we dive into insights from our two recent works on diffusion models. In the first one <d-cite key="karczewski2025diffusion"></d-cite>, we introduce novel tools for estimating likelihood (or log-density) in diffusion models. A key finding is that high-density regions of image diffusion models tend to correspond to images with less detail—blurry textures and even cartoon-like representations. We further demonstrate that (negative) $$\log p_t$$ can be interpreted as a measure of image detail. In the second work <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite>, we take this idea further, showing that $$\log p_t$$​ can actually be controlled in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. This allows us to modulate the level of detail in images generated by diffusion models, opening up new possibilities for fine-grained control in generative modeling.

## Diffusion models recap

The idea of diffusion models <d-cite key="sohl2015deep,ho2020denoising,song2021scorebased"></d-cite> is to gradually transform the data distribution $$p_0$$ into pure noise $$p_T$$ (e.g. $$\mathcal{N}(0, I)$$). This is achieved via the forward noising kernel $$p_t(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_0) = \mathcal{N}(\alpha_t \mathbf{x}_0, \sigma_t^2 I)$$ with $$\alpha, \sigma$$ chosen so that all the information is lost at $$t=T$$, i.e. $$p_T(\mathbf{x}_T \mid \mathbf{x}_0) \approx p_T(\mathbf{x}_T) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma_T^2 I)$$.
Hence, as $$t$$ increases, $$\mathbf{x}_t$$​ becomes more `noisy', and at $$t=T$$ we reach a tractable distribution $$p_T$$.
This process can equivalently be written as a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):

\begin{equation}
d\mathbf{x}_t = f(t)\mathbf{x}_t dt + g(t)d W_t \qquad \mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_0, 
\end{equation}

where $$f, g$$ are scalar functions and $$W$$ is the Wiener process.
Remarkably, this process is reversible!
The Reverse SDE <d-cite key="anderson1982reverse"></d-cite> is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rev-sde}
d\mathbf{x}_t = (f(t)\mathbf{x}_t - g^2(t)\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)) dt + g(t)d \overline{W}_t \qquad \mathbf{x}_T \sim p_T,
\end{equation}

where $$\overline{W}$$ is the Wiener process going backwards in time and $$\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$$ is the *score function*, which can be accurately approximated with a neural network <d-cite key="hyvarinen2005estimation,vincent2011connection,song2020sliced"></d-cite>.
Since $$p_T$$ is a tractable distribution, we can easily sample $$\mathbf{x}_T \sim p_T$$ and solve \eqref{eq:rev-sde} to generate a sample $$\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_0$$.

Rather surprisingly, it turns out that there exists an equivalent *deterministic* process <d-cite key="song2021scorebased,song2020denoising"></d-cite> given by an Probability-Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pf-ode}
d\mathbf{x}_t = (f(t)\mathbf{x}_t - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)) dt \qquad \mathbf{x}_T \sim p_T,
\end{equation}

which is also guaranteed to generate a sample $$\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_0$$.

### Score matching

Diffusion models are typically trained using a score matching objective, which seeks to approximate the score function $$\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$$ using a neural network $$ \mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x})$$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_t} \Big[ \lambda(t) \|\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t) - \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\|^2 \Big],
\end{equation}
$$

where $$\lambda(t)$$ is a weighting function. Interestingly, with an appropriate choice of $$\lambda(t)=g^2(t)$$, score matching corresponds to maximum likelihood training <d-cite key="song2021maximum,kingma2021variational"></d-cite>. In other words, diffusion models are likelihood-based models, as they implicitly maximize the data log-likelihood $$\log p_0 (x_0)$$.

## What is Log-Density?

Since diffusion models are likelihood-based models, they aim to assign high likelihood to training data and, by extension, low likelihood to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Intuitively, one might think that log-density is a reliable measure of whether a sample lies in or out of the data distribution.

However, prior research <d-cite key="choi2018waic,nalisnick2018deep,nalisnick2019detecting,ben2024d"></d-cite> has shown that generative models can sometimes assign higher likelihoods to OOD data than to in-distribution data. In <d-cite key="karczewski2025diffusion"></d-cite>, we show that diffusion models are no different. In fact, we push this analysis further by exploring the highest-density regions of diffusion models.

Using a theoretical **mode-tracking ODE**, we investigate the regions of the data space where the model assigns the highest likelihood. Surprisingly, these regions are occupied by cartoon-like drawings or blurry images—patterns that are absent from the training data. Additionally, we observe a strong correlation between negative log-density and PNG image size, revealing that negative log-likelihood for image data is essentially a measure of **information content** or **detail**, rather than "in-distribution-ness".

These surprising observations underscore the difference between maximum-density points and typical sets, which we explore next

</div>

### Why Does This Happen?

The observation that blurry images or cartoon-like drawings have the highest density in diffusion models seems counterintuitive. Does this imply that the model considers these images to be the "most representative of its training data"? To understand this phenomenon, it is crucial to distinguish between **probability density** and **probability**.

#### Probability Density vs. Probability

For a random variable $$X$$ with density $$p$$, the probability of $$X$$ being in a set $$A$$ is given by the integral of the density over that region:

$$
P(X \in A) = \int_{A} p(\mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{x}.
$$

If the density is constant (and equal to $$c$$) within $$ A $$, then the probability equals the product of the density and the volume of $$A $$: 

$$
P(X \in A) = c \cdot \text{Vol}(A).
$$

**It is both the density and the volume that determine probability.**

#### A Gaussian example

A helpful analogy is the standard normal Gaussian distribution in high dimensions. Its density is proportional to $$\exp(-\|\mathbf{x}\|^2 / 2) $$ at any $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$$, which is the highest at the origin $$\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$$.
However, the origin is actually far from the "typical region" of the distribution. Most samples from a high-dimensional Gaussian are not concentrated near the origin but instead fall in a region at a certain distance from it. Why is that?

Consider the probability of $$X$$ being in a thin spherical shell (where the Gaussian density is constant) at radius $$ r $$ and thickness $$ dr $$. The volume of this shell is proportional to $$ r^{D-1}dr $$, and the probability is given by:

$$
P(X \in \text{shell at } r) \propto r^{D-1} \exp(-r^2 / 2)dr.
$$

The key insight is that this probability is maximized not at $$ r = 0 $$ (the origin, where density is highest), but at $$ r = \sqrt{D-1} $$. <d-footnote> This is because for \( f(r)= r^{D-1} \exp(-r^2 / 2)\) we have \( f'(r)= r^{D-2} \exp(-r^2/2) (D-1 - r^2) \), and \( f'(r) > 0 \) for \( r < \sqrt{D-1} \) and \( f'(r) < 0 \) for \( r > \sqrt{D-1} \). </d-footnote>The typical region is the sweet spot, where neither the volume nor the density is too low.

#### Diffusion Models: High-Density Blurry Images vs. High-Volume Detailed Images

A similar principle applies to diffusion models. Although blurry or cartoon-like images occupy regions of high density, the "volume" of such images—i.e., the diversity of possible variations—is much smaller compared to the volume of regions corresponding to detailed, textured images. As a result, diffusion models assign lower log-densities to more detailed images.

## How to Estimate Log-Density?

Estimating log-density in diffusion models requires understanding the different ways in which sampling can be performed. Sampling in diffusion models can be categorized along two main axes:

### **1. Deterministic vs Stochastic Sampling**

Diffusion models generate samples by reversing the forward noising process, which can be done in one of two ways:

- **Deterministic sampling:** Uses smooth, noise-free trajectories of PF-ODE \eqref{eq:pf-ode}.
- **Stochastic sampling:** Uses noisy trajectories of Reverse SDE \eqref{eq:rev-sde}.

While deterministic sampling is often preferred for efficiency, stochastic sampling can enhance diversity by producing multiple possible reconstructions of the same noisy input.

### **2. Original vs Modified Dynamics**

Sampling with PF-ODE or the Reverse SDE ensures that each intermediate sample $$\mathbf{x}_t$$ correctly follows the correct distribution $$p_t$$ at every time step. We call this sampling with **"original" dynamics**.

However, sticking to the original dynamics does not allow us to influence the likelihood of generated samples at $$t=0$$. As we will see, extending log-density estimation to modified dynamics, where we alter the drift or diffusion terms of the sampling process, enables precise control over $$\log ⁡p_0(\mathbf{x}_0)$$. This is crucial for manipulating image characteristics such as detail and sharpness.

We define:

* **Original Dynamics**: The sampling process follows either the PF-ODE or Reverse SDE exactly, using the learned score function without modification.
* **Modified Dynamics**: The sampling process deviates from these standard dynamics by altering the drift or diffusion terms.

Previously, log-density estimation was only available for **deterministic sampling under original dynamics**—i.e., along PF-ODE trajectories <d-cite key="chen2018neural"></d-cite>.

In <d-cite key="karczewski2025diffusion"></d-cite>, we extend log-density estimation in two ways:

1. **Stochastic Sampling with Original Dynamics:** We derive how log-density evolves along **stochastic Reverse SDE trajectories**. <d-footnote> Interestingly, we prove that, in contrast to the deterministic case, replacing the true score function \( \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) \) with an estimate \( \mathbf{s}_\theta (\mathbf{x}, t) \) makes the log-density estimation biased. Furthermore, we show that this bias is given by the estimation error of the score function.</d-footnote>
2. **Deterministic Sampling with Modified Dynamics:** We show how log-density can be estimated not just for PF-ODE trajectories but for **any deterministic trajectory**.

Finally, in <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite>, we generalize this further:

3. **Stochastic Sampling with Modified Dynamics:** We prove that log-density can be estimated for **any stochastic trajectory**, not just those following the Reverse SDE. This establishes a completely general framework for log-density estimation under any sampling procedure.

The following table summarizes these advancements:

| Sampling Mode     | Original Dynamics (PF-ODE / Reverse SDE) | Any Dynamics (Modified ODE / SDE) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Deterministic** | Prior work <d-cite key="chen2018neural"></d-cite> | Ours <d-cite key="karczewski2025diffusion"></d-cite> |
| **Stochastic**    | Ours <d-cite key="karczewski2025diffusion"></d-cite> | Ours <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite> |

Since stochastic trajectories generalize deterministic ones, our final result in <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite> provides the most general formula for how $$\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$$ evolves along **any sampling trajectory**, given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
d \mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}_t)dt + G_t(\mathbf{x}_t)d\overline{W}_t.
\end{equation}
$$

In the next section, we show how this ability to estimate log-density under any dynamics enables us to **actively control it**, allowing for precise manipulation of image detail in diffusion models.


## How to Control Log-Density?

### Density Guidance: A Principled Approach to Controlling Log-Density

In <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite>, we propose **Density Guidance**, a precise way to guide how $$\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$$ evolves during sampling. We start from a general flow model

$$
d\mathbf{x}_t=\mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}_t)dt
$$

and we want to enforce

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logp-b}
\frac{d \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)}{d t} = b_t(\mathbf{x}_t)
\end{equation}
$$

for a user-defined function $$b_t$$. We show that the solution that satisfies this and diverges from the original drift the least is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{u}}_t(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}) + \underbrace{\frac{\operatorname{div}\mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}) + b_t(\mathbf{x})}{\|\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})\|^2}\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{log-density correction}}.
\end{equation}
$$

In practice, this formula is most relevant to diffusion models because we already have (an approximation of) $$\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$$. 
This is why in the following sections we assume the diffusion model with $$\mathbf{u}_t$$ given by \eqref{eq:pf-ode}.
The same framework can be used for any continuous-time flow model, provided the score is known.

**How to choose** $$b_t$$?

While density guidance theoretically allows arbitrary changes to log-density, practical constraints must be considered. Log-density changes that are too large or too small can lead to samples falling outside the typical regions of the data distribution. To address this, we leverage an observation that the following term:

$$
h_t(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\sigma_t^2 \left(\Delta \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) + \|\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})\|^2\right)}{\sqrt{2D}}
$$

is approximately $$\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$ for $$\mathbf{x} \sim p_t$$, where the data dimension $$D$$ is high. This helps determine the "typical" range of log-density changes.
Based on that, we found that the following is a good choice for $$b_t$$

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:b-quantile}
    b^q_t(\mathbf{x}) = -\operatorname{div} \mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t) \frac{\sqrt{2D}}{\sigma_t^2} \Phi^{-1}(q),
\end{equation}
$$

$$\Phi^{-1}$$ is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution and $$q$$ is a hyperparameter, which increases $$\log p_0(\mathbf{x}_0)$$ for $$q>0.5$$ and decreases for $$q<0.5$$. This definition of $$b_t$$ leads to the following updated ODE

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dgs}
\mathbf{u}^{\text{DG-ODE}}_t(\mathbf{x}) = f(t)\mathbf{x} - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\eta_t(\mathbf{x})\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}),
\end{equation}
$$

which is the PF-ODE \eqref{eq:pf-ode} with a rescaled score function <d-footnote> Interestingly, <d-cite key="karras2024guiding"></d-cite> explore scaling up the score function in the pursuit of targeting high-density regions and find resulting images lacking detail. We show that scaling the score function as in \eqref{eq:quantile-score-scaling} enables both controlling the amount of detail in both directions, but the scaling needs to be adaptive both in \(t\) and \( \mathbf{x} \) </d-footnote>  by

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quantile-score-scaling}
\eta_t(\mathbf{x})=1 + \frac{\sqrt{2D}\Phi^{-1}(q)}{\| \sigma_t \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) \|^2}.
\end{equation}
$$

</div>

**Take-home:** *Density Guidance modifies the PF-ODE by rescaling the score, achieving fine-grained control of log-density over the entire sampling trajectory.*

### Stochastic Sampling with Density Guidance

So far, we’ve discussed controlling log-density in deterministic settings. However, stochastic sampling introduces additional challenges and opportunities. In <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite>, we show that, somewhat surprisingly, we can achieve the desired **smooth** evolution of log-density $$\frac{d \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)}{dt}=b_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$$ even for **stochastic** trajectories given by:<d-footnote>
Technically, projecting out the score direction also introduces a small extra drift term. Empirically, this term is negligible, so we omit it in experiments. See <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite> for details.
</d-footnote>

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stochastic-steering}
d \mathbf{x}_t =\mathbf{u}_t^{\text{DG-SDE}}(\mathbf{x}_t)dt + \varphi(t)P_t(\mathbf{x}_t)d\overline{W}_t,
\end{equation}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stochastic-guidance-general}
\mathbf{u}^{\text{DG-SDE}}_t(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{u}^{\text{DG-ODE}}_t(\mathbf{x})+ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\varphi^2(t)\frac{\Delta \log p_t(\mathbf{x})}{\| \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) \|^2}\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{correction for added stochasticity}}
\end{equation}
$$

with $$\mathbf{u}^{\text{DG-ODE}}$$ defined in \eqref{eq:dgs} and

$$
\begin{equation}
P_t(\mathbf{x}) = I - \left(\frac{\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})}{\| \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) \|}\right) \hspace{-1mm} \left(\frac{\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})}{\| \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) \|}\right)^T.
\end{equation}
$$

Let's unpack this. We can add noise to the Density Guidance trajectory, but to maintain the desired evolution of log-density, we have to:
* Project the Wiener increment $$d \overline{W}_t$$ with $$P_t$$ onto the subspace orthogonal to the score;
* Correct the drift for the added stochasticity. To estimate $$\Delta \log p_t(\mathbf{x})=\operatorname{div} \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$$, we use the Hutchinson trick <d-cite key="hutchinson1989stochastic,grathwohl2018ffjord"></d-cite>

In practice, we set $$\varphi(t) = \widetilde{\varphi}(t)g(t)$$, where $$\widetilde{\varphi}$$ specifies the amount of noise relative to $$g$$, which is the diffusion coefficient of \eqref{eq:rev-sde}. This simplifies \eqref{eq:stochastic-guidance-general} to  

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}^{\text{DG-SDE}}_t(\mathbf{x})=f(t)\mathbf{x} - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\left(\eta_t(\mathbf{x})-\widetilde{\varphi}^2(t)\frac{\Delta \log p_t(\mathbf{x})}{\| \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}) \|^2}\right)\nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}),
\end{equation}
$$

which again boils down to the PF-ODE \eqref{eq:pf-ode} with an appropriately rescaled score function.

This is particularly useful for balancing detail and variability in generated samples. For example:
- Adding noise early ($$\widetilde{\varphi}(t) \neq 0$$ for large $$t$$) in the sampling process introduces variation in high-level features like shapes.
- Adding noise later ($$\widetilde{\varphi}(t) \neq 0$$ for small $$t$$) affects only low-level details like texture.

Our method ensures that the log-density evolution remains consistent with the deterministic case, allowing precise control while injecting controlled randomness.

<div class='l-body'>
<img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/density-guidance/stochastic-steering.jpg">
<figcaption class="figcaption" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Stochastic Density guidance allows for noise injection without sacrificing control over image detail. Samples generated with the pretrained EDM2 model <d-cite key="karras2024analyzing"></d-cite> using \eqref{eq:stochastic-steering} with different values of \(q\) and noisy injected at different stages of sampling. </figcaption>
</div>

**Take-home:** *Stochastic Density Guidance = same rescaled score approach, plus a projected noise term that preserves the intended log-density schedule.*

An interesting observation <d-cite key="song2021scorebased"></d-cite> is that simply rescaling the latent code (e.g., scaling the noise at the start of the sampling process) changes the amount of detail in the generated image. In <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite>, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon using a concept we call Score Alignment, which directly ties the scaling of the latent code to changes in log-density.

### Score Alignment

Score alignment measures the angle between:
* $$\nabla \log p_T(\mathbf{x}_T)$$ (score of noise distribution) pushed forward via the flow of PF-ODE \eqref{eq:pf-ode} to $$t = 0$$, and
* $$\nabla \log p_0(\mathbf{x}_0)$$ (score of data distribution).

Let's clarify what we mean by the ["push forward"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_(differential)). Suppose we have a curve $$\gamma$$ passing through $$\mathbf{x}_T$$, with velocity $$\nabla \log p_T(\mathbf{x}_T)$$, i.e. $$\gamma(0)=\mathbf{x}_T$$ and $$\gamma'(0)=\nabla \log p_T(\mathbf{x}_T)$$.

The pushforward of $$\nabla \log p_T(\mathbf{x}_T)$$ via a map $$F$$ is simply the tangent vector of the mapped curve, that is:

$$
\frac{d}{ds} F(\gamma(s)) \bigg\rvert_{s=0}.
$$

In our case, $$F$$ is the solution map of the PF-ODE, which maps an initial noise sample $$\mathbf{x}_T$$ to a final generated sample $$\mathbf{x}_0$$. Thus, the pushforward describes how tangent vectors evolve under the PF-ODE.

If the angle is always acute (less than $$90^{\circ}$$), scaling the latent code at $$t = T$$ changes $$\log p_0(\mathbf{x}_0)$$ in a monotonic way, explaining the relationship between scaling and image detail.<d-footnote> If the angle is always obtuse (more than \(90^{\circ}\)), scaling has the reverse effect, i.e. increasing \( \log p_T(\mathbf{x}_T) \) decreases \( \log p_0(\mathbf{x}_0) \) </d-footnote> Remarkably, we show that this **alignment can be measured without knowing the score function**, see <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite> for the proof and implementation.

<figcaption class="figcaption" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Score Alignment is a condition that guarantees monotonic impact of scaling the latent code on the log-density of the decoded sample. It is tractable to verify in practice, even without knowing the score function. Empirically we verify that it almost always holds for diffusion models on image data. </figcaption>
</div>

**Take-home:** *If SA holds, simply rescaling the latent noise $$\mathbf{x}_T$$ is a quick way to increase or decrease the final log-density (and thus control image detail).*

## Conclusion

Log-density is a crucial concept in understanding and controlling diffusion models. It measures the level of detail in generated images rather than determining in-distribution likelihood. In <d-cite key="karczewski2025diffusion"></d-cite>, we explore the curious behavior of high-density regions in diffusion models, revealing unexpected patterns and proposing new ways to measure log-density across sampling methods. In <d-cite key="karczewski2025devildetailsdensityguidance"></d-cite>, we go further, introducing **Density Guidance** and demonstrating how to precisely control log-density in both deterministic and stochastic settings.

These findings not only advance our theoretical understanding of diffusion models but also open up practical avenues for generating images with fine-grained control over detail and variability.
